            <h2>Tigers: Majestic and Endangered</h2>

            <p>Tigers, the largest of all big cats, are truly majestic creatures that captivate with their striking beauty and raw power. With their vibrant orange coats adorned with dark stripes, tigers are not only iconic but also symbolize strength and agility. These apex predators are known for their solitary and stealthy nature, seamlessly blending into the dense jungles and grasslands they call home. Sadly, tigers are facing a severe threat to their survival due to habitat loss and poaching, pushing many of their subspecies to the brink of extinction. Conservation efforts are essential to protect these magnificent animals and ensure they continue to roam the wilds of our planet.
            <br>
            <br>    
                Tigers play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of their habitats, acting as top predators that help control prey populations. Despite their formidable reputation, these feline giants are incredibly elusive, making encounters in the wild a rare and cherished experience. Efforts by organizations and governments to combat illegal wildlife trade, protect tiger habitats, and raise awareness about their plight are essential to secure a future where these incredible creatures can thrive. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the roar of the tiger continues to resonate in the wild, echoing the untamed beauty of our natural world.</p>

            <img class="webbie" src="..\info2180-lab2\webbie.jpg">
            <p>Poetry, often referred to as the language of the soul, is a powerful literary form that transcends mere words. It weaves emotions, thoughts, and experiences into beautifully crafted verses that touch the deepest corners of the human heart. With its ability to condense profound meaning into a few lines, poetry has a unique capacity to convey complex emotions and ideas with brevity and elegance.
            <br>
            <br>
                At its core, poetry is an artistic expression that captures the essence of life, provokes thought, and evokes powerful feelings. Whether it's a sonnet, haiku, or free verse, poetry offers a canvas for creativity, allowing poets to explore the human condition, celebrate beauty, and reflect on the mysteries of existence. Its timeless allure continues to inspire and connect people across cultures and generations, reminding us of the enduring power of words.</p>
